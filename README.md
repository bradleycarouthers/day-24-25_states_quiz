# day-24-25_states_quiz
Days 24 and 25 of 100.

Learning how to read and write csv (comma separated values) files, which can be opened by spreadsheet programs like Excel.

This is an interactive program that prompts the user to guess as many states as they can. As they do, the state will be "written on to" the .img file (a map of the United States in this case). Everything is title-cased and doesn't matter if the user uses all caps, lower or both. It sees the answer as title-cased.

Once the user types "exit", it creates a .csv file containing all the states that have not been guessed correctly. This list can be used as a study guide for later.

Versatility: the picture doesn't have to of the United States, and the answer bank can be relative to whichever picture. Like a collage of musicians, or a picture of planets or anything. The result, in turn, would be study material.
